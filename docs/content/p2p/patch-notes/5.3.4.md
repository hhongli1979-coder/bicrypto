# P2P v5.3.4

**Release Date:** December 7, 2025

## Bug Fixes

- **Trade Payment Details**: Fixed payment details showing scrambled characters instead of proper information
- **Admin Payment Method Edit**: Fixed the edit page not loading payment method data
- **Offer View Count**: Views now count when users start a trade, not when viewing the page (prevents fake view inflation)

- **Double Colon**: Fixed "Note::" showing with two colons instead of one

## Improvements

- **Status Badges**: Clear badges showing "In Trade", "In Offer", or "Can Delete" status

### Location Selection

- **Searchable Dropdowns**: Country, state, and city fields now use searchable dropdowns with flags
- **Smart Reset**: Changing country automatically resets state and city fields

### Admin Features
